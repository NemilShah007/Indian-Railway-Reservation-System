# Indian-Railway-Reservation-System
This is a Railway Reservation Mini Project in Java.    
This project is based on application and implementation of concepts and functions of OOPM. This Program is majorly based on the application and implementation of different functions such as Swing, etc in Java.  
Swing is used to add buttons, labels, frames and other similar elements, for easy user understanding and display of the code.  
Firstly the program takes input to start the reservation procedure then the input is taken from user as to which train express he/she wants to use based on the choice menu displayed. Now, the user has to decide number of passengers for which he wants to book the tickets after he has decided the train express.   
After deciding the number of passengers who want to travel, the cost will be displayed. This cost will be based on the train express selected and the number of passengers selected.  
The maximum size of defined in this program is 5 for input passengers so only maximum of five tickets can be booked at a time. No more tickets can be booked, as it may exceed the limit.   

This code is typed in Notepad and run using Command Prompt.   
Once the purpose of the code is served, it basically makes an exit.    

The code can be run again for fresh bookings!!!
